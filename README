=== Description

Language Description files for gedit (gtksourceview-2.0) for the great 
php-based Dokuwiki.

Works great with the Firefox extension It's all text which let you open
any textareas (textboxes) in an editor of your choice.

Tested under Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04


=== INSTALL


git clone git://github.com/zealot128/Gedit-Dokuwiki-Syntax.git
cd Gedit-Dokuwiki-Syntax
cp dokuwiki.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs



I used a ruby-File to generate the xml because I think the ruby builder Syntax is
quite nice.
Changes/Improvements welcome.
